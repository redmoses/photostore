Private Photo Store with MeanJS
===============================

This project is an attempt for learning Node.js. I chose MeanJS as the scaffolding framework. It's a very simple 
application that lets users login using the site's own authentication system along with open authentication 
using other social networks.

### Demo
I have temporarily deployed a demo of the app in this location: http://phpioto.redmoses.me
