Photo Store with MeanJS
===============================

This project is an attempt for learning Node.js. I chose MeanJS as the scaffolding framework. It's a very simple 
application that lets users login using the siteS's own authentication system along with open authentication 
using other social networks. Once a user is logged in they can share their moments with other users in the site or they can view moments shared by others. According to the application a moment is a photo with a title or brief description.

### Prerequisite
You must have MongoDB installed in your system.

### Running the application
To run the application you can follow these steps 

* Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/redmoses/photostore.git
```

* Change your directory to the cloned directory

```bash
cd photostore
```

* Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

* Finally run the app

```bash
grunt
```

### Demo
I have temporarily deployed a demo of the app in this [location](http://photo.redmoses.me)
